Martin: Detective, we are almost done preparing everything, how copy?
Wyatt: Good copy. Let's rock'n'roll.
Martin: I need you to follow the checking procedure with me. You should remember every person, but I will be reminding the details for you anyway.
Martin: How's the first room?
Wyatt: I can see them.
Martin: Nice. Do you remember Brandon, that cruise and travel pilot stabbed in the back? His best friend Mike's inside. He will talk about him.
Martin: Now, the second room.
Martin: She's Kate. Mike told us she was a voice guide during that fly above the city tour, that took place when that girl died in the central park.
Martin: Guess who piloted the plane?
Martin: Of course, the killed friend of Mike. The same friend who met the girl from the central park a couple of days before her death.
Wyatt: Interestingly, I saw their leaflets in the casualty area. Must be the way they met.
Martin: OK. Let's move on.
Martin: We reached Luca. He's the boyfriend of the girl dead in the central park. 
Martin: Please be cautious with him. The boy is very emotional. I bet it may affect his story.
Martin: Everything to now seems to work. Check the next live stream. 
Martin: The next one is Daniel who also participated in that exact flight tour. He wrote the least positive comment on their site.
Martin: Might be worth checking.
Martin: And my favourite.
Martin: Jeff, the central park's local loco. He constantly is reported to us by nearby restaurant owners. Shouting, making a mess mostly. 
Martin: Let's be honest, why wouldn't he throw a bottle and accidentally hit someone? Definitely, my bet.
Wyatt: You are right, we need to check him precisely.
Martin: Interrogators are ready whenever you are. This is your first and only chance. Watch out who you're listening!
