Judge: I see everybody's in place. We should get back to work. The short break ends now. The main detective is asked to stand.
Judge: Dear Mr Wyatt. Can you tell us what happened to the girl found dead in the central park?

(optional)Wyatt: Daniel killed her.
(optional)Wyatt: A drunkard named Jeff killed her.
(optional)Wyatt: 
Judge: Please explain with details.
