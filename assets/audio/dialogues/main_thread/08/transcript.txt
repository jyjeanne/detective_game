Waiter: Here's your order, sir. Let me leave this small leaflet from our befriended company.
Wyatt: Fly tours above the city? I don't suffer a lack of high-powered emotions.
Waiter: Maybe, someday you will! Enjoy your meal.
Wyatt: Hello, Detective Wyatt speaking.
Martin: Hello, Martin's here. We have a lot of work. I want to tell you we found that missed guy we were talking about yesterday. 
Martin: He's been killed.
Wyatt: What?!
Martin: He was stabbed in the back. This morning body seemed to fell down from the stairs alerting neighbours. 
Martin: He was some kind of cruise and travel pilot.
Wyatt: Martin, e-mail me everything ASAP.
Martin: Fine, later.
Wyatt: My God... The pilot... Fly tours above the city...
