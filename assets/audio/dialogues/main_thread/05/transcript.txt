Wyatt: Good morning, the name's Wyatt. I heard it's something with our CCTV installation.
Technician: My pleasure. Unfortunately, our online service noticed strange troubles in your camcorders network. 
Technician: It broadcasts correctly. But when it comes to saving data locally, some crashes appear unexpectedly.
Wyatt: Practically, what does it mean for us?
Technician: Practically, you should be aware that sometimes you may not be able to access video archives.
(conditional)Technician: On the other hand, live stream proceeds without any errors.
(optional)Wyatt: Excuse me? It's not grocery, security is important all the time here.
(optional)Wyatt: It's a serious issue...
(optional)Wyatt: Please do your job, I won't interrupt you anymore.
(answer)Technician: My apologizes, sir. I'd suggest involving one of our 24 h guards to watch the live stream. It's free for you.
(answer)Technician: You're right. I've involved one of our 24 h guards to watch the live stream. It's free for you.
(answer)Technician: One more thing. I've involved one of our 24 h guards to watch the live stream. It's free for you.
Wyatt: Good. These are the last moments of that installation, I hope.
Technician: We are only waiting for the new one's delivery. We'd be already installing it.
Wyatt: See you later, then.
