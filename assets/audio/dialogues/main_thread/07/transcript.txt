Martin: Welcome detective.
Roger: Hi Wyatt.
Wyatt: Good to see you, gentlemen. Roger, I see you've finally earned your right-hand man.
Roger: Indeed, they just don't let me retire peacefully.
Wyatt: Old buddy, enthusiastic like always. It was a couple of time since you were here.
(conditional)Roger: The longer the better. I'd have nothing against seeing you only in an evening pub. Need I tell you what happened?
(optional)Wyatt: Oh, the pub would be great. Anyway, you don't suggest I am not well informed, do you?
(optional)Wyatt: It's about that central park's accident, I presume?
(optional)Wyatt: You know I don't like pubs. Tell me more.
(answer)Roger: Me? Never. How could you don't know about that girl found dead in the central park?
(answer)Roger: Yes, yes. You're well informed.
(answer)Roger: You should at least try some pubs. I was mentioning that girl found dead in the central park.
Roger: Next to her body, we found only crashed glass. Nothing more, nothing less. It's hard to explain. 
Roger: Her boyfriend swears to God, she was happy and without any job, social or family problems.
Martin: What's friggin us the most, we tracked in the city monitoring, the guy she visited a couple of days ago, has gone missing recently.
Wyatt: Here we go again... Have you prepared an action plan yet?
Roger: Of course! You officially take leadership.
Wyatt: I thought you at least ask.
Roger: Martin, let me introduce you to the case's new chief detective. Clarify him everything!
