Interrogator3: Welcome, Mr Luca.
Luca: H.. H.. Hello.
Interrogator3: I believe you certainly know why we're here.
Luca: Because someone killed my girlfriend!
Interrogator3: Please, stop. There is no evidence.
Luca: She would never ever put herself in danger situation. It can't be the accident.
Interrogator3: Please, stop! The only way you can help is cooperating with us.
Luca: You can't even find who's stolen my car's mirror, useless bastards.
Interrogator3: Watch your language, Mr Luca. Unless you want us to become impolite. 
Luca: Oh, I admit, impoliteness suits you. 
Interrogator3: Fine. Cut to the point. I am going to ask you some questions. The more information you provide, the better results and situation clearance we achieve. Consider it as a mutual benefit.
Luca: Then stop talking, and ask your questions. 
Interrogator3: Respect me, kid, because you're stepping on the loose ground. 
Luca: I'm sorry. Shall we start?
Interrogator3: Let's start from the beginning. Tell me about your job.
Luca: I used to be a pizza delivery guy.
Interrogator3: In love with details, huh?
Luca: I started when I left university. I've never wanted to be a medical doctor. I decided to gain money and emigrate or start something on my own.
Interrogator3: Did you plan to follow your dream?
Luca: Exactly.
Interrogator3: How did you meet your girlfriend?
Luca: We.. I need a break.
Interrogator3: Please take some tea.
Luca: Thanks. I met Joanna in the restaurant. She was studying there. When I saw her, I froze. She was like a dream.  
Interrogator3: And did you dare to pick up her?
Luca: I am shy. But at that moment. I don't know. Something told me to act.
Luca: We talked. Magically, 5 minutes has extended to 2 hours. I arranged the first date. The first month past like eye blink.
Interrogator3: For how long have you been together?
Luca: Since 2015.
Interrogator3: A huge amount of time.
Luca: Have you ever truly been in love?
Interrogator3: Why?
Luca: You ask very direct and personal questions. It's fair if I ask too.
Interrogator3: If you say so. I have. Like usually happens, it was a college time. It lasted for one year. 
Luca: And?
Interrogator3: And we broke up. Different life purposes, different dreams. Hard times. But you finally you wake up stronger.
Luca: I'm sorry.
Interrogator3: Don't be. I don't.
Interrogator3: Tell me about the casualty day.
Luca: Or the murder day.
Interrogator3: Anyway, tell me. What were you up to?
Luca: A day like always. I was in my job. Afternoon, I hit the gym. And in the evening I was in my home, waiting for my girlfriend.
Interrogator3: Can someone confirm it?
Luca: Of course. The job and the gym are obvious. After, I was playing video games with my friends. Online. 
Interrogator3: How did you find about the accident?
Luca: Hospital called me. I was inquired to come and recognize a victim. She had my telephone saved as ICE. I came there. And I saw her.
Interrogator3: Do you know Brandon?
Luca: That killed pilot?
Interrogator3: Do you know anything?
Luca: Why would I?
Interrogator3: Don't lie. We know you got jealous of him.
Luca: I don't know what you're talking about. 
Interrogator3: You perfectly know. Our info says, your girlfriend was in touch with him, and you got angry because of that.  
Luca: I don't know Brandon, Randon and any other Don.
Interrogator3: Hmm, as you say so. I assure you, you're not first to lie here. There were many before you. None of them succeeded. 
Luca: I have nothing more to say.
Interrogator3: OK. Interrogation ends.
