Interrogator3: Welcome, Mr Luca.
Luca: H.. H.. Hello.
Interrogator3: I believe you certainly know why we're here.
Luca: Because someone killed my girlfriend!
Interrogator3: Please, stop. There is no evidence.
Luca: She would never ever put herself in danger situation. It can't be the accident.
Interrogator3: Please, stop! The only way you can help is cooperating with us.
Luca: You can't even find who's stolen my car's mirror, useless bastards.
Interrogator3: Watch your language, Mr Luca. Unless you want us to become impolite. 
Luca: Oh, I admit, impoliteness suits you. 
Interrogator3: Fine. Cut to the point. I am going to ask you some questions. The more information you provide, the better results and situation clearance we achieve. Consider it as a mutual benefit.
Luca: Then stop talking, and ask your questions. 
Interrogator3: Respect me, kid, because you're stepping on the loose ground. 
Luca: I'm sorry. Shall we start?
