Interrogator3: Please take some tea.
Luca: Thanks. I met Joanna in the restaurant. She was studying there. When I saw her, I froze. She was like a dream.  
Interrogator3: And did you dare to pick up her?
Luca: I am shy. But at that moment. I don't know. Something told me to act.
Luca: We talked. Magically, 5 minutes has extended to 2 hours. I arranged the first date. The first month past like eye blink.
Interrogator3: For how long have you been together?
Luca: Since 2015.
Interrogator3: A huge amount of time.
Luca: Have you ever truly been in love?
Interrogator3: Why?
Luca: You ask very direct and personal questions. It's fair if I ask too.
Interrogator3: If you say so. I have. Like usually happens, it was a college time. It lasted for one year. 
Luca: And?
Interrogator3: And we broke up. Different life purposes, different dreams. Hard times. But you finally you wake up stronger.
Luca: I'm sorry.
Interrogator3: Don't be. I don't.
