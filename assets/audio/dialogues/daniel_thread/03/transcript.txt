Anton: I have another superb idea, by the way. 
Daniel: Talk to me more.
Anton: Once I was walking in the central park, I found this. Look at it. 
Daniel: Why would you want to discover casually, when you can see it from above? Fly tours.. Sounds amazing!
Anton: We can discover this city in one another way.
Daniel: Cool bro. You're paying.
Anton: No?
Daniel: The highway gate. 
Anton: Huh, OK.
Daniel: Back to flying above the city. Let's call them. We should book it, perhaps the next week?
Anton: I'll inform you.
