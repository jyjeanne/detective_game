Anton: Hello, this is Anton. I am calling you to ask about the fly above the city tour.
Mike: Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
Anton: I am interested in signing in. Can you show me the details?
Mike: The deal is simple. You consult a date with me. I confirm it. You transfer 30% of the final cost. Then you arrive at the airstrip. You participate in a short meeting with a pilot and a guide. After, you start. The cruise takes around 2 hours. There are extras during it and constant voice guide support.  
Anton: Thank you. I'd like to take two seats, for me and my friend Daniel, the following weekend.
Mike: Fine. Give me 30 minutes and I'll text you a confirmation.
Anton: Thank you, looking for your message.
