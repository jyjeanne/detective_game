Anton: Look, now!
Daniel: That was a good one, mate!
Anton: Okay, enough for now. Need to go through city peacefully. No more tickets in the current month. 
Daniel: What?! Again?
Anton: They got me in front of my house. I said to myself 'OK, bro, final loop'. 
Anton: The thing is, you never should do 'one last time ride'. It's the place where all bad happens - accidents, and tickets of course.
Daniel: How much?
Anton: Fifteen hundred. 
Daniel: Damn! It's a lot.
Anton: Good fun always costs.
Daniel: Don't make me cry. It's so true.
