Anton: Look, now!
Daniel: That was a good one, mate!
Anton: Okay, enough for now. Need to go through city peacefully. No more tickets in the current month. 
Daniel: What?! Again?
Anton: They got me in front of my house. I said to myself 'OK, bro, final loop'. The thing is, you never should do 'one last time ride'. It's the place where all bad happens - accidents, and tickets of course.
Daniel: How much?
Anton: Fifteen hundred. 
Daniel: Damn! It's a lot.
Anton: Good fun always costs.
Daniel: Don't make me cry. It's so true. 
Anton: I have another superb idea, by the way. 
Daniel: Talk to me more.
Anton: Once I was walking in the central park, I found this. Look at it. 
Daniel: Why would you want to discover casually, when you can see it from above? Fly tours.. Sounds amazing!
Anton: We can discover this city in one another way.
Daniel: Cool bro. You're paying.
Anton: No?
Daniel: The highway gate. 
Anton: Huh, OK.
Daniel: Back to flying above the city. Let's call them. We should book it, perhaps the next week?
Anton: I'll inform you.
