Interrogator4: What happened when you started?
Daniel: Good question. The plane started to fly!
Interrogator4: Did I ever tell you to be serious?
Daniel: Soon after we took off, the pilot, Brandon, circled the airstrip and headed to the river. 
Daniel: We saw a couple of the city's monuments. When we were above the central park things got excited. 
Daniel: Brandon told us to stand tight because one of the extras was about to come. And he wildly did some crazy manoeuvres above the central park.  
Daniel: I loved them. Then we returned home.
Interrogator4: Did any suspicious happen above the central park?
Daniel: I don't remember. I think it didn't. Anyway, I was truly enjoying a moment.
Interrogator4: Thanks for your feedback.
Daniel: Any time.
