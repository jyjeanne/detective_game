Jeff: Sunny day. Sorry, I don't remember the date. Trees in the park started flowering. 
Jeff: Brandon was there giving leaflets. Funny boy, he approached me.
Brandon: Good morning, boss. Have you heard about our company?
Jeff: Hey, kiddo. What company? 
Brandon: We can take you to our plane and watch this park from above. Take this leaflet. Nice, huh?
Jeff: Yeah, sure! If only you provided a free pass for me, I'd truly care about your opinion here.
Brandon: Take these coins. Have a drink on me.
Jeff: You know how to arrange advertising company properly, boss!
Brandon: Thanks, mate.
