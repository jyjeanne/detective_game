Interrogator5: Oh, Jeff. How is it? You always occur when something happens. 
Interrogator5: Why don't you work with us, you're here frequently anyway.
Jeff: Thanks! But I am a free man. I am not going to work for someone. I work only for myself.
Interrogator5: It's your life, after all. Maybe someday you will tire of living in the central park.
Jeff: I am already. I think I'll move on. I am the kind host, but you guest me too often.
Interrogator5: Maybe it's because all the mess you're making? We must respond to local calls.
Jeff: I am rarely partying. Once I start, I go hard.
Interrogator5: It depends on "rarely" interpretation.
Jeff: Only one restaurant owner doesn't say good morning to me. You can't be friends with everyone.
Interrogator5: Certainly. When was the first time you saw Brandon?
Jeff: That dead pilot?
