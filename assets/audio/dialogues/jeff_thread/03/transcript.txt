Interrogator5: Of course, you drank after.
Jeff: Only a little.
Interrogator5: We noticed you like to throw bottles. You know it's dangerous?
Jeff: I see what's on your mind. I did, once or two times. But I am harmful. I would never ever hurt someone.
Interrogator5: But we found that dead girl with a crashed glass next to her head. Guess conclusions. 
Jeff: Guess what? I even wasn't there that day.
Interrogator5: Explain.
Jeff: I was next to the river with my friends. We were fishing. 
Jeff: Brandon would confirm, if only he was alive. I usually shared some fish with him.
Interrogator5: I believe everything your friends say, for sure.
Jeff: You can ask that office guy, who cooperated with Brandon.
Interrogator5: Mike? Don't worry, I'll ask.
Jeff: Listen.
