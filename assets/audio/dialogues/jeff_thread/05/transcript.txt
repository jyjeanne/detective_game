Interrogator5: Do you know how Brandon died?
Jeff: I believe hew was killed.
Interrogator5: What makes you think that?
Jeff: As you perfectly know, I am usually at the central park. I see people.
Interrogator5: Who have you seen?
Jeff: Once I saw Brandon meeting that girl which has been found dead. Advertising things.
Interrogator5: And?
Jeff: And somehow her boyfriend got to know. I realized when I saw them in the following days. He was really jealous and angry about that. When they met Brandon again he wanted to fight him.
Interrogator5: What do you mean?
Jeff: He shouted very loudly. He put his knife out from the pocket. I think he believed Brandon was about picking up her girlfriend. Finally, they ended without causing troubles.
Interrogator5: Her boyfriend, Luca, said he was never met Brandon.
Jeff: You see by yourself. Luca is definitely up to something.
Interrogator5: Do you know that Brandon was stabbed in the back?
Jeff: Oh my God. Do you need more proves or what? Arrest that goddamned Luca!
Interrogator5: Do you know something else? Do you officially accuse the Luca?
Jeff: I liked Brandon. I know, I threw and crushed some glass bottles in the central park. But I know what I saw. I can memorize Luca's knife.
Interrogator5: Please do. We'll run some tests.
