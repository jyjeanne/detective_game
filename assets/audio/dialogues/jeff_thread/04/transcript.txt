Jeff: We spent on fishing the whole day. And the best time for salmon is evening. I liked Brandon, so I left something for him.
Mike: Hi Jeff. Are you not in the central park?
Jeff: Nope, friend. Today we were fishing. I got something for you.
Mike: Oh, what are they?
Jeff: The finest salmons in the city. You can't buy it in the store directly.
Mike: Thank you! I'll put them into the fridge. It's late, please come tomorrow, I'll prepare something for you as a reward. Brandon will be too.
Jeff: Be sure, uncle Jeff will come!
