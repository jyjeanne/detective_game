Interrogator5: Her boyfriend, Luca, said he was never met Brandon.
Jeff: You see by yourself. Luca is definitely up to something.
Interrogator5: Do you know that Brandon was stabbed in the back?
Jeff: Oh my God. Do you need more proves or what? Arrest that goddamned Luca!
Interrogator5: Do you know something else? Do you officially accuse the Luca?
Jeff: I liked Brandon. I know, I threw and crushed some glass bottles in the central park.
Jeff: But I know what I saw. I can memorize Luca's knife.
Interrogator5: Please do. We'll run some tests.
