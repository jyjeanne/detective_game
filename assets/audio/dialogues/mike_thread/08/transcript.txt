Mike: I have not met her. But Brandon told me about her. He was having dinner at the Outrageous Burgers in the central park. 
Mike: She noticed him because of the company's clothes and asked immediately about our tours. I believe she wanted to sign in. 
Mike: Moreover, it occurred she was some kind of a graphic designer.
Mike: Brandon used his charm and soon after recruited that girl to create some outstanding graphics for us. 
Mike: He told her boyfriend was kinda jealous about it but finally agreed.
Interrogator1: Last question. What were you doing when Brandon died?
Mike: I did exit from the office earlier and went on short holidays. Brandon stayed there for longer. 
Mike: This was the last time I saw him. I tried to call him on the following day. 
Mike: On the next day, I informed you, police guys.
Interrogator1: Can someone confirm it?
Mike: Of course, you can call my mother or the apartment's owner.
Interrogator1: Do you have any idea who could kill Brandon and that girl?
Mike: I have not the slightest idea. But I think it must be the same person.
Interrogator1: Thank you, you can rest now.
Mike: Thanks God.
