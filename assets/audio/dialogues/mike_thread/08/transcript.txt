Mike: I have not met her. But Brandon told me about her. He was having dinner at the Outrageous Burgers in the central park. She noticed him because of the company's clothes and asked immediately about our tours. I believe she wanted to sign in. 
Mike: Moreover, it occurred she was some kind of a graphic designer. Brandon used his charm and soon after recruited that girl to create some outstanding graphics for us. He told her boyfriend was kinda jealous about it but finally agreed.
Interrogator1: Last question. What were you doing when Brandon died?
Mike: I did exit from the office earlier and went on short holidays. Brandon stayed there for longer. This was the last time I saw him. I tried to call him on the following day. On the next day, I informed you, police guys.
Interrogator1: Can someone confirm it?
Mike: Of course, you can call my mother or the apartment's owner.
Interrogator1: Do you have any idea who could kill Brandon and that girl?
Mike: I have not the slightest idea. But I think it must be the same person.
Interrogator1: Thank you, you can rest now.
Mike: Thanks God.
