Mike: Brandon, we need to spread those leaflets. It'll bring us more clients.
Brandon: Do you have any idea? We are going downtown and smile to people?
Mike: We already did. We additionally shall leave some materials in crowded areas.
Brandon: Central park?
Mike: Certainly. I know some food halls there. We'll exchange leaflets and more. We promote them, they promote us. Should be an easy deal.
Brandon: Well done my marketing boy!
