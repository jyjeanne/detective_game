Mike: Finally, he told me his biggest dream.
Brandon: Hey Miky Mike. It's time to get you off the ground.
Mike: Sure! I am not going, I hate heights. 
Brandon: Quiet. I thought about something. You're a good accountant, aren't you? 
Mike: What do you have in mind?
Brandon: The local travel company. I take tourist to the plane I fly with them above the city. You take your calculator and manage our office.
Mike: How generous you are. Can I even take, I dunno, a book? Maybe it prevents me from such a boringness there.
Interrogator1: Did you agree?
Mike: Negative. But I didn't even notice and Brandon convinced me.
