Kate: Alright, ladies and gentlemen. We are above the city's marvelous river. Please your eyes. Soon we'll reach the central park.
Daniel: Wow, mate. It's a beautiful moment. Cheers for it! 
Anton: Stop with that beer, moron. They'll finally realize.
Daniel: Don't bullshit me, I am Johny Rivers. There's a man who leads a life of danger.
Daniel: Yes, mommy. One last shot. 
Anton: Can't we just drink it after?
Daniel: Why are you afraid? We'll drink after too!
Anton: Estas Loco!
Interrogator2: Why didn't you warn them?
Kate: We were busy. Brandon was piloting and I was voice-guiding them. We noticed it while black boxes checking.
