Interrogator2: Correct me if I'm wrong. You are saying that Daniel threw a glass object through a window exactly while you were above the central park?
Kate: This is what we concluded from our logs.
Interrogator2: I bet my hands that thing killed that girl.
Kate: You may be right. Check timings.
Interrogator2: But Brandon's death is still not clarified. Why would someone want to kill him?
Kate: I have no idea at all. I've seen Brandon as a very peaceful man.
Interrogator2: Glad we make it. Take your time. No more questions.
Kate: Thank you!
Interrogator2: Excuse me, only one.
Kate: Sure, I knew...
Interrogator2: Shall I bring you a tea or a coffee?
