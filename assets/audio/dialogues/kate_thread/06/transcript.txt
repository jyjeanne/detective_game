Kate: Please check your seat belts, take pictures and get ready. We will be going flat out.
Brandon: We are right above the central park. I am about to show you how to circle properly. Leave cameras, enjoy the moment. Hold tight!
Daniel: Oh my god. I need to take a breath.
Daniel: Damn!
Anton: Close it! Daniel, stop, what are you doing! You get us in trouble.
Daniel: I just wanted to take some fresh air! Fine, I am doing nothing until the end of the journey.
