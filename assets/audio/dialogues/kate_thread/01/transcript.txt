Interrogator2: Good morning Ms Kate.
Kate: Hi!
Interrogator2: Nice to see you in a good mood. We still need you to tell us about what happened.
Kate: I'd doubt you if you didn't.
Interrogator2: Fortunately or not, it's our job to be overly curious.
Kate: Ask then.
Interrogator2: For how long are you associated with Brandon's company?
Kate: For half a year. We met with Brandon in the central park. He was advertising his company, established with his friend Mike.
Interrogator2: Did he approach you?
Kate: Yes. We talked. I was in the middle of the city tour with tourists from Japan. He offered me a deal.
Interrogator2: What exactly?
