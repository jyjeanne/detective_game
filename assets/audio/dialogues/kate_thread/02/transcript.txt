Kate: Okay, we're meeting in 2 hours. You're free to go!
Brandon: Hey there! Name's Brandon. Have you heard about our fly tours above the city?
Kate: Are you going to steal my clients?
Brandon: Huh, no!
Kate: Sure...
Brandon: Only a few of them... You can go too.
Kate: What do you mean? I am the guide here. 
Brandon: Then you must be really good with boring talks to tourists.
Kate: You're boring, little boy.
Brandon: And you can be the guide. In our company. 
Kate: Why would I want to?
Brandon: I am offering you my co-pilot seat. We grab tourists. I fly above the city. 
Brandon: You talk about passing monuments, buildings, you know, casual tourist things. It's a dream job!
Kate: Give me your number. And don't disappoint me with your offer.
Brandon: Just try it. If you won't like it, you're free to leave. But you're gonna like it. Keep an eye on your clients!
