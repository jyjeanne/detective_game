Kate: I tried. The first time was awkward. The second too. But finally, I used to it. 
Interrogator2: And how about your other job?
Kate: I managed to split my duties. One week on the ground, the other on the fly. I improved my time management.
Interrogator2: Did you like working with Brandon?
Kate: Yes. I knew it was hard-time between Mike and Brandon. But I joined them after it. We were working not only as colleagues but also as friends. 
Interrogator2: Do you think Brandon could hurt someone?
Kate: I heard he threw a bottle aiming at his friend. Honestly? I couldn't believe it until he admitted it. He said it was only once when he lost mind.
Interrogator2: If once did, why wouldn't he do it again?
Kate: I don't know. It's something you can feel. He just would not.
Interrogator2: So, how to explain dead girl in the central park with a crashed glass next to her? They crossed their paths earlier.
Kate: Brandon is not guilty. Apart from he's dead too.
Interrogator2: Tell me about that fly tour you participated in the day of the tragedy.
